temperature, growth rate and bacteria type as its columns where valid
data entries fulfills the following requirements:
* Temperature is between 10 and 60 degrees C
* Bacteria growth rates must be positive
* Bacteria types must be a positive integer between 1 and 4, corresponding
  to:
   * 1 - Salmonella enterica
   * 2 - Bacillus cereus
   * 3 - Listeria
   * 4 - Brochothrix thermosphacta
